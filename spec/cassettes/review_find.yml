        the process easy.  They provided soup to nuts help.\r\nI came in with the
        project idea.  Reilly envisioned the project better than I did. They told
        me what they would need and how long it would take.  They were clear on what
        I should expect and what they expected from me. They have online progress
        reports and notes which made the process easy to track and manage.\r\n\n\n\r\nThere
        were some services they didn''t do in house but they made good suggestions
        as to who could do it for us. They had our best interests in mind.\r\n\n\n\r\nGreat
        experience. I have recommended them to others and I will continue to do it.","review_status":"publish","total_score":1.0,"source":"call","is_featured":false,"ip_address":"76.126.198.98","admin_user_id":2,"invite_id":null,"reviewer_location_state":null,"reviewer_location_city":null,"created_at":"2008-08-21T19:57:28Z","updated_at":"2008-08-21T19:57:28Z","topics":[{"id":1,"review_topic":"Quality","rating":1.0},{"id":3,"review_topic":"Professionalism","rating":1.0},{"id":5,"review_topic":"Will
