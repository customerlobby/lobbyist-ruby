        \"empty house cleaning\". After they arrived, I was told that it would end
        up costing me $180.00 for my townhouse because they counted 12 areas, where
        I only counted 8. Then after I questioned the price, they left my townhouse
        without cleaning or calling me to tell me that they left wthout cleaning the
        carpets. I am very disappointed that people conduct their business this way.
        Completely unprofessional! I then called all 3 numbers listed on the website
        and no one has called me back to tell me why they didn''t clean my carpet.
        I don''t know how they can keep a business going when they behave so unprofessionally.\r\n","review_status":"not_publish","total_score":0.2,"source":"web","is_featured":false,"ip_address":"74.96.252.176","admin_user_id":null,"contact_id":82924,"invite_id":null,"reviewer_location_state":"VA","reviewer_location_city":"Dumfries","topics":[{"id":52489,"review_topic":"Service","rating":0.2},{"id":52491,"review_topic":"Will
