        is a cool dude.\r\n\r\n5/26/15 bc: inc call on ms line from Scott, asked if
        someone named Wayne works here. He says he knows KF is his AM, but he was
        asking for WB because apparently someone from DFW (?) Advertising had called
        and said that Wayne had referred them to him. He asked after KF, but asked
        to be put thru to WB''s vm after I told him KF had gone home for the day.
        Emailed KF notes on my conversation w/ Scott. \r\n3/13/15 kab: Campaigns case
        study call with Scott. he''s still a cool dude.\r\n12/11/14 rj: dc settings
        missing, called for poppy/scott, poppy will call me back.\r\n12/3/14 rj: upgraded
        dc, awaiting files... gottem.\r\n12/1/14 rj: called for poppy re: dc, not
        in, try again tmrw.\r\n11/25/14 tj: inc call, Scott. He''s pretty damn cool.
        He''s having trouble logging in. I have an idea why. Checked new admin users,
        he''s listed as inactive, switched him back to active. good to go now. We
        joked, we laughed, I cried, he went on his way, I cried some more. All is
        good.\r\n11/21/14 no contact due to recent touch.\r\n11/17/14 rj: contacted
        scott, poppy not in, call to upgrade direct connect tmrw instead.\r\n10/28/14
        rj: hm for scott re: qb upgrade.\r\n9/8/14 rj: called poppy in response to
        request from scott re: updating direct connect.  sent her a followup email
        with the download link.\r\n7/16/14 kab: called for Scott, put on hold for
        a while, hu and sent email to check in. DC is pulling contacts just fine (and
        plenty of them), but most are just names with no email addresses or phone
        numbers. reminded Scott we would need one of those bits of information included
        in his customers'' QB entries to gather reviews from them.\r\n5/16/14 kab:
        Scott called in w/new cc info. the existing one on file was compromised.\r\n4/21/14
        rj: called scott to manually update to latest dc version.  the updates might
        not work because of norton antivirus.  will investigate, but good for now.\r\n3/18/14
        tj: reviewer Jonathan R unresponsive. Challenge accepted.\r\n3/13/14 tj: Challenge,
        Jonathan R, not a customer. Asked for proof of service.\r\n3/12/14 kab: fixed
        Google+ and Yahoo! SI links. recent touches from rj to get DC going. no call
        today.\r\n2/27/14 rj: ran into some problems with version, had poppy delete
        setting file to fix dc crash problem, and running test upload to make sure
        everything is okay.  if not, will probably have to de-authorize the app and
        re-authorize it.\r\n1/22/14 rj: enabled auto-queueing and will contact later
        today to confirm. contacted scott, only concern was that he wanted to change
        his cl password, was worried if that would affect the app.  don''t think so,
        it''s used the one time to authenticate, then the link is established... as
        far as i know.  we''ll find out in a day or two i guess.  he''ll contact me
        if he has any questions or concerns.\r\n1/13/14 rj: upgraded to auto-update
        version of scotty, let scott know we''re days away from release.\r\n1/6/14
        rj: installed new version of scotty w/ scott, waiting on data.\r\n12/12/13
        rj: confirmed install for 2:30 today.  install successful, received old log
        files for debugging.\r\n12/11/13 rj: sent email to set up time for scotty
        update tmrw.\r\n12/4/13 rj: installed scotty with scott.  lol.\r\n10/28/13
        kb: got one new NCC.\r\n6/27/13 kb: Ted just met these guys. I consider that
        a pretty substantial member touch. \r\n2/14/13 kf: very strong acct. sent
        email to both users re: syndication and fb app. they add ncc''s pretty consistently
        and seem to generally have it together. \r\n07/23/12 mm: Sent Scott email
        re: NCCs and new buttons (Copied Poppy).\r\n03/22/12 mm: Scott called and
        asked a quick question about FB.  I explained that he has to login under his
        personal account but it will give him the option to publish to the business
        page.  All set.\r\n03/20/12 mm: Bridget was having trouble entering a contact.  I
        called her back and had her do it through the Quick Invites button under Contacts
        and with her permission removed 4 credits to pay leaving them with one.   Emailed
        Scott about FB/Twitter.\r\n12/18/12 rj: talked to Scott about ncc, bridget
        is responsible for that, enabled si, sent followup email with more info on
        si and fb.\r\n11/1/11: (AB) Talked to Bridget about negative pending review
        from Glenn who wants to give a new review over phone (he doesn''t do email
        apparently). I OKed a second customer call with him. Reviewer ended up declining
        even tho he is happy now.\r\n8/17/11:  (AB) Scott called back in about Business
        Level of service and I upgraded him. He still wanted to keep the credits to
        pay. \r\n8/17/11: (AB) Bridget called wanting to know how to add contacts
        to call. I tried to tell her about business level but she said that''s not
        her department, Scott would be one to make a decision about that. \r\n08/16/11
        kb: Had a talk with a girl over there who claims to have had problems entering
        customer calls. I walked her through the process and she said she would try
        later. Note: thee guys do a tone of credits to pay. \r\n05/11/11 kb: talked
        to Scott -- they are going to do a credit to pay. \r\n05/10/11 kb: left hm
        for either Scott or Poppy re: ncc. I emailed both of them re: ncc, fb, and
        twitter. \r\n1/28 - na call back at around 345\r\n(J) 1/27 -left my number
