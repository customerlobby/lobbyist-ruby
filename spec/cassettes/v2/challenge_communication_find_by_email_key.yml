        kab: took down Dan Jones''s review to avoid violating our own policy. Emailed
        him to thank him for his time, his feedback on 3 Gorillas, his patience while
        we got a valid email address from him (bad addresses and WRs kept his first
        reviews for 3 Gorillas from publishing), etc. he stalked 3 Gorillas so we
        want to mitigate.\n11/13/14 kab: updated our featured reviews to include Lee
        Keller''s stellar and recent praise!\n10/8/14 kab: conducted Call review with
        Lee Keller of Keller Roofing & siding. it was a pleasure to publish.\n04/12/13
