        need a appointment, I need to tell you guys I''m not very happy with you.
        I asked to have someone look at my stove, because the 3-6-9 buttons don''t
        work. Your guy showed up on time and had a mother board with him. I asked
        what it was and he he a new board. I asked how much is it and he said $172.
        Then he said didn''t they give you a quote? I said no. He said do you want
        it put in and I said I can''t use it without I guess. He charged me $266.86
        for the job. I found out this AM that I could have paid a little more and
        bought a new one. I feel like you guys blindsided me and I''m not very HAPPY.
        What do you intend to do to resolve this?","created_at":"2013-03-22T11:52:40Z","updated_at":"2013-03-22T11:52:40Z","company":{"company_id":9577,"company_name":"Martin
