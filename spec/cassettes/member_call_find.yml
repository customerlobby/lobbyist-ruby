        that send an invitation. Explained auto invite setting and how the trigger
        for invitations being sent is if that payment is reflected in the invoicing
        software, and how we could disable that so that we only pull contact info,
        then he would manually send invites. He said that he would still prefer not
        to have DC, but thanked me for the info. \n6/29/15: mt: called, got transferred
