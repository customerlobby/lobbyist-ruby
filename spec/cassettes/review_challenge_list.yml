        Inadequate Service","review_body":"Anthony Sylvan was hired to renovat my
        pool. When after year one, it had cracks and significant leaks, they sent
        someone to fix the repairs, but  it was just a band-aid and did not address
        the underlying cause. After I showed the Anthony Sylvan engineer a photo of
        the pool shell, he stated that he would never plastered the pool as their
        subcontractors did. They did not take into account the seams/spaces between
        the large walls. In the winter, these walls move, ever so slightly and cause
        cracks along every wall seam. It has cracked and leaked every year, and every
        year, they promise it will be fixed. It never gets fixed and now that the
        warranty is not in effect, they do not come out anymore. My costs to empty
        and refill my 30'' by 50'' pool was about $2,000.00 every time they came to
        fill the cracks with putty. Gets expensive after a few years. The root cause
        was never addressed. They pushed off the real fix until the warranty ran out.
        The other problem was that they poured cement down one of my skimmers. Never
        worked since. Do not use this company. The Anthony Sylvan people do not take
        responsibility for their subcontractors and most are subcontractors.","review_status":"challenged","total_score":0.2,"source":"web","is_featured":false,"ip_address":"38.104.12.170","admin_user_id":null,"invite_id":null,"inviteable_id":null,"reviewer_location_state":"PA","reviewer_location_city":"Doylestown","post_to_facebook":false,"created_at":"2015-06-23T20:21:23Z","updated_at":"2015-07-05T20:15:28Z","company":{"company_id":29943,"company_name":"Anthony

        have been a customer there for some time. I''ve spent around $10,000 there

        arrive in no more than 2 weeks. 2 weeks later I called only to find out it
        would be another month. A month later I called again to learn it would be
        even longer. I was never contacted by your team. I had to sit and wait and
        make my own calls to see what the hold up was.\r\n\r\nFinally after I came
        by to visit one of your managers, I was assured someone would pick up the
        missing piece from Akron and deliver it that week-which did happen. I was
        also told I would receive credit towards my account for the hassle. That has
        NOT happened. \r\n\r\nNeedless to say, because of your weak sales team, you
        have likely lost a loyal customer. \r\n\r\nThere. Now you have my review.

        disappointed","review_body":"I ordered the wallpaper for windows product online.
        Rather than attempt to cut it myself, I opted for the pre-cut product (at
        an added fee). In order to ensure the measurements were correct, I did them
        myself and had them checked by a handyman. When the product arrived, the cuts
        were off, by a lot. I contacted the company with my concerns and even included
        photos. They insisted it was correct. I made it clear that I wasn''t looking
        for a refund, but felt it was only appropriate that they removed the cutting
        fee, since we had to completely re-cut one entire panel. Understand - this
        is a charge of less than $10. After numerous back-and-forth emails (and one
        that talked about going to the management team), I just gave up. The simplest
        solution I have to this problem is not to give them my business or encourage
        others to do so. In the end, a product like this is simple and can be ordered
        at multiple places.  So, in the end, what matters is to provide good customer
        service.  This is probably the worst I''ve encountered.  Strange to me that
        they would do battle (and not back off until trouncing the customer) all over
        $10.  Management - I would strongly recommend you reach \"Nice Companies Finish
        First\" and advise your customer service team (Shannon) of the concepts learned.","review_status":"challenged","total_score":0.27,"source":"web","is_featured":false,"ip_address":"184.90.179.66","admin_user_id":null,"invite_id":null,"inviteable_id":null,"reviewer_location_state":"FL","reviewer_location_city":"Orlando","post_to_facebook":false,"created_at":"2015-06-24T17:19:45Z","updated_at":"2015-06-24T18:46:03Z","company":{"company_id":10182,"company_name":"EtchArt,
