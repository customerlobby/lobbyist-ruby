        the MK. Nope, they''ve been going with email invites. Mentioned biz lvl svc.
        Suggested doing cc''s, but she says the call reviews don''t sound like their
        customers... Told her we transcribe as closely to the caller''s original words
        if not verbatim. She prefers they write and not talk. passed to kb.\n1/29/14

        the customer''s real city. Told him I would ask call agent to verify customer
        was alright with edit. (Call agent confirmed, customer had hung up before
        asking for city, edit made). He also wanted to verify what Andrew was told
        about calls, he said he heard we only call 1 customer a day and he wanted
        to know if there were any upgrades. Looks like AH told him that we call 2,
        which is correct, so I told him that I saw 2 calls were in progress, and 2
        more are set to be called after them. Also let him know SQ was OFF, so anyone
        else he adds won''t be delayed. He was good with that. \n6/2/15 ah: inc call

        ks: recent touch re:DC. No call today\n11/14/14 tj: inc call, Ray. He added
        Trevor Engels for email invite when he wanted it as a call. Readded customer
        for call review. Talked about si''s & DC. He got si''s set up and uses quickbooks.
        He seemed slightly interested in DC, but wants to cherry-pick.\n10/20/14 kab:
        lhm with call center. sent email info re:DC.\n8/26/14 tj: Ray called. He sold
        the Co. name and now has to change the name from \"Tekmax Technologies, Inc.\"
        to just \"Tekmax Technologies\". Done. Then he asked how to add ncc''s. did
        a quick wt. He thanked me and went on to do business.\n7/18/14 tj: call center.
        meh. lhm. sent email re: ncc''s, si''s, & DC.\n6.18.14 scd: Ray called in
        to ask me to switch his requested calls to email invites. most of them had
        not been called yet, so it was easy to do. Told him a few had been called
        already. no prob. I asked why he didn''t want to use the calls and he said
        b/c $20 was too expensive on top of what he was paying already. wtf?! I tried
        explaining that''s only if he wants extra call reviews. He said he understood,
        but still wanted those switched. hmmmm I don''t think he understands it. I
        did what he asked.\n6/18/14 kab: Ray called in for a couple reasons. 1) changed
        biz name by removing \", Inc.\" 2) his first/only/not so hot review by Sylvia
        Smith, while Not Published, still had his star ratings showing as 2/5 overall.
        oops. he knows getting more reviews with his creds would be one solution,
        but for a more immediate solution I passed the issue to rj. he fixed it, of
        course :) I emailed Ray update (including explanation of why he might still
        see 2/5 stars on Google..Google has to catch up) and NCCs reminder.\n6.5.14
        scd: Spoke with Ray for a long time over his first review being a neg review...ugh.
        Sent him email w/options and response examples. Sent second welcome email
        asking for ncc''s.\n6.5.14 scd: Ray''s 1st review was  a neg review-d''oh.
        he''s set on getting Sylvia Smith''s review taken down. I talked him off the
        cliff this time, he''s going to send a WR b/c it doesn''t violate the pub
        policy. I urged him to use the cust calls and credited him an extra one to
        sweeten the deal. Ray really is a nice guy, but he is deadset on only getting
        positive reviews. He didn''t want to hear the positive on negative reviews!!
        Well, we shall see what happens in 7 days...I did send him an email w/response
        examples just in case. He was happy when we got off the phone.\n5/19/14 Ray
        is a really nice dude, very interested in redirection and most importantly
        having a spot people without review accounts can still review his business.
        Got review immediately from first set of email invites. Still waiting for
        CC''s.","customer_call_notes":null,"trial_source":"house","partner_id":null,"partner_account_id":null,"last_synd_stat_date":"2014-05-21T17:17:54Z","last_credit_grant":"2015-06-21","sales_status":false,"date_live":"2014-05-27T00:00:00Z","user_notes":null,"enable_referral_marketing":false,"enable_retention_marketing":false,"last_handwritten_review_credit_grant":"2014-05-21","sugar_lead_id":null,"sugar_account_id":"775d6c01-e7f7-ae99-e825-5375ce694d24","sugar_opportunity_id":"94379bd8-8ffb-e8b1-76e2-5375ce7f6be3","created_at":"2014-05-16T08:38:55Z","updated_at":"2015-11-09T22:32:11Z","status":"active","sales_user_id":133,"system_of_record":"Quickbooks","activity_feed_created":true,"data_dedupe_enabled":false,"direct_connect_status":"not_running","direct_connect_status_date":null,"use_new_mapper":false,"direct_connect_install_date":null,"direct_connect_install_status":"downloaded","direct_connect_installed_by":"self","direct_connect_notes":null,"current_balance":"0.0","account_manager_id":null,"salesforce_account_id":null,"salesforce_opportunity_id":null,"default_enterprise_company":null},"admin_user":{"admin_user_id":415,"salesforce_id":null,"first_name":"Allison","last_name":"Tabacco-Hines","email":"ahines@customerlobby.com","password":null,"is_total_admin":1,"is_active":1,"is_account_manager":false,"screen_name":"ahines","sales_team_id":null,"created_at":"2015-05-11T15:56:00Z","updated_at":"2015-07-09T17:51:08Z","auth_key":null,"persistence_token":"907b82e0b59d3a31809017b633daf9ed496897db875d0247f0b5cc4a4f931eae1aee0c15edc77e8054095cef31f329482a4a2b49d3632c4e5d225f5422bb91aa","role":"member-services","employment_type":"full-time","crypted_password":"5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99","last_request_at":"2015-07-09T17:51:08Z"}},{"id":51461,"company_id":31971,"admin_user_id":415,"call_number":4,"completed_at":"2015-06-01T18:41:29Z","status":"completed","priority":4,"notes":"6/1/15
