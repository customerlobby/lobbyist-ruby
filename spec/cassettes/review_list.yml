        important to me. It is one of my \"calling cards\" for the biz. I need it

        & let me know it was down. After the initial panic had subsided, I tried to
        contact my old website host (will call NONAME from this point on) to no avail.
        I didn''t have any disks of the site (my bad) to be able to send to anyone
        else so they could host me. So after a week of trying to reach NONAME, I called
        WebVideo Vision to see if they could help me. In my mind, I thought there
        was no way, anyone could get this site going again. Phil immediately took
        this project at 10:00am & within 30 minutes had contact info for the NONAME.
        Phil then contacted NONAME to ask for the files. I went to lunch at 11:30am,
        still thinking no way. An hour later I have a phone message from Phil letting
        me know he had the files & he was waiting for go daddy to recognize the new
        web host site. Whew, what a relief! I went to hopeless to happy within 4 hours!
